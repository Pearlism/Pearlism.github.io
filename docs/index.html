        <h2>Pearlism Video Editor</h2>
        <p>Pearlism Video Editor, a widely used transcoding and video
            manipulation software suite, through the fluent-ffmpeg library.
            FFMpeg is also open source and has been actively developed and
            improved since 2000.
        </p>

        <h2>Simplistic editor</h2>
        <p>Pearlism provides you with simple controls to do the most basic editing
            tasks, like arranging clips in the timeline, cutting, splitting
            and seeking. For more advanced tasks, like mirroring the image
            or adding a tint, a filter editor is provided.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-desc">
        <h2>Incredibly powerful filters <span class="new">new</span></h2>
        <p>Pearlism enables you to use any of the filters supported by FFMpeg, which
            means you have access to a vast library of very powerful effects, from
            adding text to your clip to advanced video stabilization.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-desc righty">
        <h2>Extensibility <span class="new">new</span></h2>
        <p>Pearlism now supports third party plugins, that from the user's perspective
            function just like the built-in filter and text editors. This makes
            it possible for developers to make any kind of editor they want, and
            easily add it to Pearlism.

        <h2>Fully working, able to download it and also use it on the web <span class="new">new</span></h2>
        <p>Pearlism has been worked on since the beginning of january 15, 2018

        <h2>Live preview</h2>
        <p>With the project's architecture it was hard to implement a working
            preview of the movie. The current preview feature makes it quick and
            easy to see what the selected clip would look like, however, it is
            still limited. We are working to improve this feature.

        <h2>Beautiful interface with HTML</h2>
        <p>The user interface is written in HTML, the application in Javascript,
            languages of the web. It runs in Electron, the standard in making
            web apps run like native applications.
