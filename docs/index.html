        <h2>Your my favorite Mom</h2>
        <p>Youve been the best mom anyone could ask for, your so understanding, 
           youve helped me through everything even when you arent in the right 
           mindset nor a good state in mind. ive realised over the past years 
           that everyone has there own problems even if they arent expressing
           them! and you dont always express them considering you dont want
           me to see you hurt, crying, ect. but to me i find peace in knowing
           you care about me and yourself all at the same time. im so thankful
           for someone caring that much about me and i know allen cares too but
           ive never really got super close with him becuase i couldnt get over
           that my real dad didnt wanna be my dad. and allen has been in my life
           for more than just my kid years, hes been there for both of us for 
           12 almost 13 years and has definitly improved both of us knowing
           we had a father figure for me and a loving husband for you!

        <h2>Best mom ever</h2>
        <p>Youve provided me with the help i needed and the support everyone needs,
           your are truly an amazing person! youve been helping me forever with my 
           troubles, ive really only cared about how i feel. and i regret all those 
           years ive wasted on my mental health but if it werent for getting the help
           i needed, we wouldnt have a good relationship becuase of how both of us think 
           alike. you understanding how i felt about my dad, you understanding that kids 
           have depression just of nothing, you understanding that people dont always like
           talking about how they feel nor wanna talk at all. but you got me to speak 
           about how i feel towards things, im so greatful what our relationship has came too.
           im glad i can tell you everything thats bothering me, im glad i can tell you everything
           without you getting mad or upset. thank you for everything that youve done for me. and
           thank you for everything you helped me get through. without you i wouldnt have a place on 
           earth. but becuase of you im still alive and the happiest boy that you can have!
